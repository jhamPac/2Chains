# 2Chains.js - â›“

### Motivation
2 Chainz - BOATS II -
"Woke up on the [BLOCK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Blocks), hit it with a [FORK](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain)"

This project is to help you gain a better understanding of the technology driving the latest craze in cryptocurrencies. By implementing a very basic blockchain leveraging docker, node and plain old javascript I hope you will gain a better grasp of the blockchain technology and its many possibilities outside of just a form of money. By understanding blockchain, you will then begin to see what cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are trying to solve.

Concepts to come in future commits...
* smart contracts
* decentralized autonomous organizations
* Web 3.0 

### What is blockchain technology
Blockchain technology is a P2P distributed ledger of transactions that are secured using immutable math. It solves the problem of trust on the internet oddly enough without the need of trust, just math. The following are some good resources to understand blockchain.

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)
* [Visual Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8)
* [Visual Demo Pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras)

### Key concepts of 2Chains.js
From Naivechain: Check out this [blog post](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54#.dttbm9afr5) for a more detailed overview of the original project. 2Chains.js builds on top of...

* HTTP interface to control the node
* Use Websockets to communicate with other nodes (P2P)
* Super simple "protocols" in P2P communication
* Data is not persisted in nodes
* No proof-of-work or proof-of-stake: a block can be added to the blockchain without competition

### Key skill/knowledge required to set the environment up
This project requires some knowledge of the following. Currently this project is geared towards macOS users.

* Docker
* Node programming
* Webpack 4
* JavaScript
* terminal
